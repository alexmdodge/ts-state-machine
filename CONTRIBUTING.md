# Contributing

Before contributing ensure that you've reviewed the current project, including the styling enforced by ESLint.

## Adding Code

If you would like to contribute code, please open an issue and we can discuss changes and approach. By nature this repository and accompanying code are intended to remain simplistic, so if additional changes are made we should ensure they are divided in clear ways so those looking for examples have digestable chunks of code to look at.

## Branching and Merging

When starting work, please begin a new branch, with an appropriate name pertaining to the issue `feature/GH-123` for example. Feel free to provide as many commits during the development process, but once a request is approved, please rebase and squash your commit with a formatted message accroding to the conventional commits styling: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
